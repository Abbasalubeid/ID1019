# ID1019 Programming II

<h2>Course Contents</h2>

<p>The course covers the following topics:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Programming techniques used in functional programming languages</li>
	<li>How programmes can be divided into several executing threads and how these can be coordinated</li>
	<li>Examples of programming techniques such as recursive definitions, non-updateable data structures, functions of higher order and closures</li>
	<li>Coordination of multiple threads through modification of common data structures and message passing between processes</li>
	<li>Use of a programming language as the main language and comparison with other functional languages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intended Learning Outcomes</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Use recursion, pattern matching and non-modifiable data structures upon implementation in a functional programming language</li>
	<li>Use functions as first order objects and work with the functions of higher order</li>
	<li>Explain the basics of functional programming, its structure and operational semantics</li>
	<li>Evaluate functions with regard to time complexity</li>
	<li>Use message based multi-threaded programming</li>
</ol>
